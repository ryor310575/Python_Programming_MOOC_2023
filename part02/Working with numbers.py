# Pre-task
# Please write a program which asks the user for integer numbers.
# The program should keep asking for numbers until the user types in zero.
#
# Sample output
# Please type in integer numbers. Type in 0 to finish.
# Number: 5
# Number: 22
# Number: 9
# Number: -2
# Number: 0
# Part 1: Count
# After reading in the numbers the program should print out how many numbers were typed in. The zero at the end should not be included in the count.
#
# You will need a new variable here to keep track of the numbers typed in.
#
# Sample output
# ... the program asks for numbers
# Numbers typed in 4
# Part 2: Sum
# The program should also print out the sum of all the numbers typed in.
# The zero at the end should not be included in the calculation.
#
# The program should now print out the following:
#
# Sample output
# ... the program asks for numbers
# Numbers typed in 4
# The sum of the numbers is 34
#
# Part 3: Mean
# The program should also print out the mean of the numbers.
# The zero at the end should not be included in the calculation.
# You may assume the user will always type in at least one valid non-zero number.
#
# Sample output
# ... the program asks for numbers
# Numbers typed in 4
# The sum of the numbers is 34
# The mean of the numbers is 8.5
# Part 4: Positives and negatives
# The program should also print out statistics on how many of the numbers were positive
# and how many were negative. The zero at the end should not be included in the calculation.
#
# Sample output
# ... the program asks for numbers
# Numbers typed in 4
# The sum of the numbers is 34
# The mean of the numbers is 8.5
# Positive numbers 3
# Negative numbers 1
